<h1>ADVENT OF COBOL: Day 2</h1>
<div id="navbar">
  <a href="http://thequux.github.io/posts/">&lt;&lt; Back to posts</a>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I cheated. Two days in and the desire was already overwhelming.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I spent most of the day on day 1’s writeup, and so I didn’t have much
time for day 2.  I guess that means that the future writeups will have
to be a lot shorter, which will give you more time for doomscrolling;
You can thank me later.  However, that did mean that I didn’t have the
time to read input in its original form, and had to do a bit of
preprocessing on it before I could load it into a table:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>cat advent2.txt  |sed -e &#34;s/-/,/&#34; -e &#39;s/ /,/&#39; -e &#39;s/: /,/&#39; &gt;advent2.csv</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I copied that to PASE, just like yesterday, and then went about
defining my record format.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, we have four fields in our input:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The minimum number of matchingcharacters, a number between 1 and 20</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum number of matching characters, also a number between 1 and 20</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The character to match, which is a single character</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The password that supposedly fits those criteria, which is a string of up
to 20 characters</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This should be relatively straightforward to fit into DDS, and in fact it is:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-dds" data-lang="dds">     A          R ADVDTA021
     A            MINCOUNT       2S
     A            MAXCOUNT       2S
     A            LIMITCHR       1A
     A            PASSWD        20A</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have a new value for the type field: <code>A</code>, which is an alphabetic
character; aside from that, this is no different from last week.  Even
loading our CSV into the data table is exactly the same as last week;
`CPYFRMIMPF’s defaults are to load a CSV file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alas, we have no choice but to move on to the program.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ll skip over the identification and environment divisions, because
they’re much the same as before.  I’m just reading from a different
file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our data division, though, is totally different.  There aren’t a lot
of records here, but I didn’t want to retype the whole thing.
Fortunately, IBM i has the concept of an externally described file,
which allows you to just import declarations from your DDS and the
compiler will generate your record definition for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cobol" data-lang="cobol">       DATA DIVISION.
       FILE SECTION.
        FD SCAN1.
         01 DATA-RECORD.
         COPY DD-ADVDTA021-I OF ADVENT2020-ADVDTA021.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s break that last line down a little, because, for a four word
line of code, there’s a lot going on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>COPY</code> is COBOL’s equivalent of <code>#include</code>; it just textually pastes
code from another source.  Its general form is</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cobol" data-lang="cobol">       COPY member [OF file].</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, if we had another source member called <code>INCLUDES</code>, we could
include it using</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cobol" data-lang="cobol">       COPY INCLUDES OF ADVENTSRC.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>file</code> part of that is optional, but we include it because the
default is not to copy from the current file, but rather <code>QCBLLESRC</code>.
I guess I’ve been going against the grain by putting all my source in
a single file, and thus losing out on convenience features like this.
Oh well, I’ll try to do better tomorrow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an IBM extension, though, if the member name starts with <code>DD-</code>, it
translates from DDS source; you then give the name of the DDS member
and what type of record you want to import.  We’re only reading from
the database, so we can use <code>-I</code> as the record type.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At first, it wasn’t completely clear what I’d get out of that, but I
just threw the compiler at it and read the listing.  There were
naturally a ton of compiler errors, but I did find what I needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As always, full details are available in
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_ibm_i_73/rzasb/copyf2.htm">IBM’s docs</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can move on to our local variables:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cobol" data-lang="cobol">       LOCAL-STORAGE SECTION.
        01 CHAR-COUNT PIC 9(2).
        01 BADPWD PIC 9(4) VALUE IS 0.
        01 GOODPWD PIC 9(4) VALUE IS 0.
        01 NREC PIC 9(5) VALUE IS 0.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is still pretty straightforward.  I did learn that I can use
<code>9(4)</code> as a shorthand for <code>9999</code> in the <code>PICTURE</code> clause, which is a
nice timesaver.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we have our code.  This is still pretty short, but we’ll
still break it up into sections to examine it more closely.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cobol" data-lang="cobol">       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
        MAIN-PROCESSING SECTION.
         SETUP.
           OPEN INPUT SCAN1.
         READ-DATA.
           READ SCAN1 NEXT RECORD AT END
             GO TO PRINT-REPORT
           END-READ
           ADD 1 TO NREC</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is still pretty much the same as our first program, so no need to
explain anything here.  The other major language on IBM i, RPG, has a
nice feature where it implicitly includes this outer loop for you.
Maybe it’ll make a guest appearance soon.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cobol" data-lang="cobol">           MOVE 0 TO CHAR-COUNT
           INSPECT PASSWD TALLYING CHAR-COUNT FOR ALL LIMITCHR</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I expected COBOL to be absolutely <strong>terrible</strong> at character handling,
but this is it.  This counts the number of <code>LIMITCHR</code> in <code>PASSWD</code>, and
puts the result into <code>CHAR-COUNT</code>.  Quite frankly, I’m impressed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>INSPECT</code> command can do more than this; it can count leading
characters, replace one character with another, etc.  It’s actually
pretty powerful, but I will admit that I have a hard time seeing how
to use it in any situation that’s not this contrived.  I guess
we’ll see.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cobol" data-lang="cobol">           IF CHAR-COUNT IS LESS THAN MINCOUNT
             OR CHAR-COUNT IS GREATER THAN MAXCOUNT THEN
             ADD 1 TO BADPWD
           ELSE
             ADD 1 TO GOODPWD
           END-IF
           GO TO READ-DATA.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That condition is a helluva lot more verbose than it would be in, say,
C, but it’s completely clear what it’s doing.  There’s really nothing
surprising here, except that I expected to need to type a lot more.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cobol" data-lang="cobol">         PRINT-REPORT.
           DISPLAY &#34;PROCESSED &#34; NREC &#34; RECORDS&#34;
           DISPLAY &#34;FOUND &#34; BADPWD &#34; FAULTY RECORDS&#34;
           DISPLAY &#34;FOUND &#34; GOODPWD &#34; ACCEPTABLE RECORDS&#34;
           CLOSE SCAN1
           STOP RUN.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And here’s the final output bit. Again, nothing of any interest here,
and it gives the right result, so we’ll move straight on to part 2.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(Well, it took me a few tries, because I misread the spec as wanting a
count of the <strong>bad</strong> passwords. Oops)</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_part_2">Part 2</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OK, now we need to look at two specific character positions, not just
count the total mistakes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This actually took me a long time, because I couldn’t find any
documentation on how to take a substring of a string in COBOL. To be
honest, even now that I know how to do it, it’s just not documented in
ILE COBOL.  It was in COBOL for z/OS, and while the two are very
different products, the z/OS code ended up working on i.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway, we’ll need another variable in our local storage section:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cobol" data-lang="cobol">        01 TESTCHR PIC X.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>X</code> is a picture of any character, you see.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also need to change our lovely inspect statement to something much worse:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cobol" data-lang="cobol">           MOVE PASSWD(MINCOUNT:1) TO TESTCHR
           IF TESTCHR IS EQUAL TO LIMITCHR THEN
             ADD 1 TO CHAR-COUNT
           END-IF
           MOVE PASSWD(MAXCOUNT:1) TO TESTCHR
           IF TESTCHR IS EQUAL TO LIMITCHR THEN
             ADD 1 TO CHAR-COUNT
           END-IF</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here you can see how subscripting works. You can only do it as part of
a MOVE statement, and the syntax seems to be <code>VARIABLE(START:LENGTH)</code>.
Whatever; it works.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then we just need to change the if statement to check whether
<code>CHAR-COUNT</code> is 1, but I won’t bore you with that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That’s all for today, folks!</p>
</div>
