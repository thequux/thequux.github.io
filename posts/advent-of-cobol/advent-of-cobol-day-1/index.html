<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every year, Eric Wastl hosts an event called
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020">Advent of Code</a>, which consists of two
coding challenges per day from the first of december through Christmas
day. The first few challenges tend to be fairly simple, but then they
gradually increase in difficulty through the event.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This makes Advent of Code a wonderful way to learn a new language or
platform, and last year I used it as an excuse to learn Forth. This
year, I decided to try a new system, and wanted something that was
decidedly different from anything I had worked with before. So, of
course I reached for the strangest platform I have access to: COBOL on
IBM i.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IBM i (formerly i5/OS, and before that, AS/400) is IBM’s lesser known
server platform for businesses not large enough to need a mainframe.
They intended it to be a server appliance for small businesses, but
they left the design in the hands of a research team in Rochester, who
came up with a very unusual design. For a start, the primary way that
most users would interact with the system is a “green screen” block
mode terminal <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>. When you start trying to write code for
it, the documentation instructs you to first create a “source
physical file”.  This got me curious what other kinds of files there
were, and after some investigation I realized that “physical file”
is the IBM i term for a database table, and “logical file” is the
IBM i term for a view. In other words, even your <em>source code</em> is
stored in database tables. The platform is based around a single-level
store, which basically means that every file in the system is
constantly mapped into memory, and always has the same address; to
accomplish this, pointers are 128 bits long and the system has special
hardware to verify that a value in memory is OK to use as a pointer.</p>

<p>In short, we’re not in Kansas anymore.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My hope is that you, dear reader, will be able to follow along on your
own and perhaps learn a new system along with me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It can be tricky to get access to an IBM i machine, and even once you
do, learning how to operate the editor and operating system will take
some time. I’ll write more about how to take your first steps with IBM i
later, but for now, you can go to <a href="https://www.pub400.com">PUB400</a> and
request a free account. In order to actually use it, you’ll need a 5250
emulator; I recommend either
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-i-access-client-solutions">iACS</a> or
<a href="http://tn5250j.org/">tn5250j</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IBM’s documentation for i is very complete, but it was written in a time
when the hardware would come in one box, your 5 meters of documentation
would come in a second, and a friendly field engineer would come in a
third to install the machine for you. As such, you’ll be spending a lot
of time at first just looking through the documentation to find the
details you need.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For today, just go to
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_ibm_i_74/rzase/esrcst.htm">Compiling,
Running, and Debugging COBOL programs</a> for a tutorial on operating the
editor and compiler; I’ll try to explain everything else you need. In
the future, I’ll be skipping over the basics and talking only about new
things, so if you find this intolerably slow, it will get better.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_getting_started">Getting started</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Firstly, I needed to get the data into a form that I can use from
IBM i.  Considering that the system really wants to use record-based
I/O <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup>, we
first need to create a physical file and load the data into it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have two options for how to create a physical file. SQL is always an
option, but I prefer the old-fashioned approach (creating data
description specifications), so that’s what we’ll do here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, though, we need a source physical file to write our code in, and
it’s probably best to first create a library (akin to a directory in
UNIX or a schema in SQL) to keep everything together. You can create the
library by typing the following command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock no-outdent">
<div class="content">
<pre>CRTLIB ADVENT2020</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The command to create a source file is a bit more complex, and it would
be really nice to be able to have an on-screen reference as we put our
command together. Fortunately, i has our back. Just type <code>CRTSRCPF</code>
and press <code class="kbd">F4</code>. You’ll get the following screen:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="crtsrcpf-prompt.png" alt="CRTSRCPF Prompt" width="724" height="498"/></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is common to split your source up by the language it’s in. However,
for simplicitly, I’ll just keep all my source in a single file called
<code>adventsrc</code>. We also want to have somewhat longer lines than the
default, so we’ll create our source file with a record length of 112.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="crtsrcpf-filled.png" alt="CRTSRCPF with parameters given" width="724" height="498"/></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While we could just hit enter here to run the command, it’s worth
examining this screen more closely first, as you’ll be using screens
like this a lot and there’s a lot more you can do here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, you’ll notice that there are a list of function keys at the
bottom of the screen, including <code>F13</code> and <code>F24</code>. If you look closely
at your keyboard, however, you’ll find that the F keys only go up to 12.
Fortunately, you can reach <code>F13</code> by pressing <code>Shift-F1</code>, <code>F14</code>
using <code>Shift-F2</code>, all the way up to <code>Shift-F12</code> for <code>F24</code>. I’ll
use the names listed on the screen, and let you translate them in your
head, as it’s both good practice and how I think about it in my head.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s worth pressing <code>F13</code> here to see how to use this screen to the
extent of its abilities, but for now just press <code>F24</code> a few times to
flip through all the keys you have available. Perhaps the most
interesting are <code>F9</code>, which shows you all the options available to you
(of which there are too many to shake a stick at), and <code>F14</code>, which
shows you that you could have skipped the entire screen by typing the
command</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock no-outdent">
<div class="content">
<pre>CRTSRCPF FILE(ADVENT2020/ADVENTSRC) RCDLEN(112)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you’re done exploring that screen, press enter to submit the
command, and now we’re ready to start writing our code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From this point on, I won’t discuss the interface in depth; just know
that you can nearly always get help by pressing <code>F1</code>, have the system
offer you a prompt by pressing <code>F4</code>, exit a little by pressing
<code>F12</code>, or exit a lot by pressing <code>F3</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To enter the editor, run the command</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you can see, very little is case-sensitive here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enter the following code:</p>

<div class="listingblock dds">

     A            DATA           4S</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This specifies a record format named <code>ADVDTA011</code> with a single column
named <code>DATA</code> that is a 4-character-wide decimal. I won’t go into
detail on it, because</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_ibm_i_74/rzakb/kickoff.htm">IBM’s
documentation</a> covers it far better than I could</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, we need to turn this into an actual physical file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock no-outdent">
<div class="content">
<pre>crtpf file(advent2020/advdta011) srcfile(advent2020/adventsrc)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we just need to get our data into this file. There are a variety of
ways to do it, but the way that I did it was to copy the file to my home
directory in PASE (yes, IBM i has a complete UNIX-ish system on the
side, but be warned that it is <em>very</em> strange. For a start, it’s based
on AIX, which is at best maliciously compliant with POSIX).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I got my file in using scp, then used <code>cpyfrmimpf</code> command to
actually load the data into my physical file (Note: this is formatted
as multiple lines for clarity, but you’ll need to enter all of the options on a
single line):</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock no-outdent">

           RCDDLM(*ALL)
           MBROPT(*REPLACE)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If everything went well, then this should complete successfully. You can
see the data in the file by running <code>STRDFU</code>, selecting option 5
(“Update data using temporary program”), and then specifying the name
of the physical file we created earlier.</p>

<h2 id="_i_thought_this_was_going_to_be_about_cobol">I thought this was going to be about COBOL…?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That, unfortunately, is as long as we’re going to be able to
procrastinate; it’s time to grit our teeth and start writing COBOL for
real. This is going to be a bit unpleasant, so we’ll take it piece by
piece.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The structure of a COBOL program is very strictly regimented. Your code
is sorted into divisions, which then are divided into sections, and your
statements only appear within those sections. (well, there are also
paragraphs and sentences, but I don’t understand those divisions
completely, so let’s just ignore them, shall we?)</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_environment_division">ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here we have two sections:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cobol" data-lang="cobol">      ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
        CONFIGURATION SECTION.
         SOURCE-COMPUTER. IBM-ISERIES.
         OBJECT-COMPUTER. IBM-ISERIES.
         SPECIAL-NAMES. REQUESTOR IS CONSOLE.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To be honest, I copied this directly from the IBM documentation. The
<code>SOURCE-COMPUTER</code> and <code>OBJECT-COMPUTER</code> paragraphs are not used for
anything, but they seem to be a sensible place to document exactly
<em>which</em> variant of COBOL we’re using. The <code>SPECIAL-NAMES</code> paragraph,
though, <em>does</em> do something useful, though we don’t actually take
advantage of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It turns out that IBM i has two I/O streams: a system console and the
“requestor” (which may be an interactive terminal, or it may be a job
log for batch programs). The declaration <code>REQUESTOR IS CONSOLE</code>
essentially says “when I do I/O to CONSOLE, I really mean REQUESTOR.
Don’t bother the sysop with my blathering.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As it turns out, we won’t do I/O to CONSOLE in this program, so we don’t
get any benefit from this section at all, so it was a complete waste of
time. Let’s be honest with ourselves, though; you would have used it
reading Hacker News anyway, so nothing of value was lost.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cobol" data-lang="cobol">        INPUT-OUTPUT SECTION.
          FILE-CONTROL.
           SELECT SCAN1 ASSIGN TO DISK-ADVDTA011
             ORGANIZATION IS SEQUENTIAL
             ACCESS MODE IS SEQUENTIAL.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Aha! Now we’re getting out of the boilerplate and getting into something
that’s actually relevant to us. This is where we actually define which
files we’re going to be using. Here, we say that we’ll want to access
the file ADVDTA011 using the name SCAN1, and we’ll always start with the
first record in the file and read them in sequence. There are other
types of file organization as well: relative mode lets you jump to
records by number, and indexed mode works lets you access records by
their primary key.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_data_division">DATA DIVISION.</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the name indicates, here’s where we’ll divide up our data.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cobol" data-lang="cobol">       DATA DIVISION.
       FILE SECTION.
        FD SCAN1.
         01 S1DTA PIC 9999.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Oh, you thought we were done with files, did you? Nope, we still need to
define what each record looks like. Here we say that the file that we
refer to as SCAN1 has one field, named S1DTA, and it looks like
“9999”. The PIC keyword, you see, says “Here’s a picture of what this
data will look like!”, and then we have four 9’s, because we want to be
able to store four digits in it.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-cobol" data-lang="cobol">       LOCAL-STORAGE SECTION.
        01 CALC-RESULT PIC 99999999.
        01 PRODUCT PIC 99999999.
        01 NREC PIC 99999 VALUE IS 0.
        01 NUMBERS-TABLE.
        05 SEEN-NUMBERS OCCURS 2020 TIMES PIC 1 VALUE IS B&#34;0&#34;.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two similar sections, <code>LOCAL-STORAGE</code> and
<code>WORKING-STORAGE</code>, of which we’ll only use one. Both contain variables
local to the procedure; the main difference between them is that working
storage is shared between all invocations of a procedure, whereas local
storage is specific to the invocation. For our purposes, this
distinction doesn’t matter, but it’s good practice to use local storage
if you can.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To explain our variables, I’ll need to explain the algorithm we’ll be
using. The most obvious algorithm is to test each pair of records; if
they sum to 2020, we’ve found our solution. However, it’s much more
efficient to remember which values we’ve seen and simply check whether
we’ve already seen the other number in the pair.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, we can see what variables we need:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A pair of variables to store intermediate caluclation results
(<code>CALC-RESULT</code> and <code>PRODUCT</code>). Note that these are 8 digits long, so
that we can fit the full product of two 4-digit numbers into it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A variable to store the number of input records, for diagnostic
purposes (<code>NREC</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, an array of booleans to indicate which values we’ve already
seen (<code>PIC 1</code> is an IBM extension that stores a boolean).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is another aspect to all of all of these definitions that I’ve
ignored so far: the level (here, <code>01</code> and <code>05</code>). COBOL does support
structures (which it, perhaps confusingly, calls records); each variable
that doesn’t have a level number of <code>01</code> forms a part of the record
stored in the last variable with a higher record number. The only reason
we use a record here is that, for some reason I don’t understand, the
<code>OCCURS</code> clause is not valid on variables with a level of <code>01</code>, but
every variable must be part of a record with level <code>01</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_procedure_division">PROCEDURE DIVISION.</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we get to the meat of our program.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Execution starts at the beginning of the procedure division. We’ll only
have one section, which we’ll call <code>MAIN-PROCESSING</code>; this name is
irrelevant and you can already forget it. Next we start a paragraph
named <code>SETUP</code>, which makes sense; the first thing we need to do is
open our file for input.</p>

the control flow is all done using <code>GO TO</code>. Each time through the

<p>Unlike the message display, where the most recent message was clearly at
the top, the printer output display has the most recent prinout at the

understanding of why greenbar paper was sold in 2000-sheet boxes.</p>

<p>We’ll be able to reuse our data file, but we can no longer use the same
trick to process the file in linear time. There is a nice trick to do it
in quadratic time, by computing a table of pairwise sums and then
finding the third number in the triplet; however, we’ll keep things
simple and use the cubic time algorithm. After all, the data isn’t
particularly large.</p>

<p>Whew lads. That looks horrifying, but it’s actually not that bad.
PERFORM is a general purpose control flow statement in COBOL, and here
we’re using it as a roughly C-style for loop. I expect we’ll be seeing
it a lot.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before each loop, we need to compute the lower bound of the loop,
because COBOL doesn’t have the concept of expressions. Oh well, as
obnoxious bits of languages go, this isn’t so bad. We see more of why
expressions are a really great idea when calculating the sum and
product, but despite being verbose it’s still very clear what’s going
on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I won’t go any further into this version, because there’s really not
very much going on, and if we compile and execute it like we did the
first version, we get an answer that will give us our second star of the
day.</p>
